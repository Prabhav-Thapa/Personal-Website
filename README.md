Hello Everyone,

My name is **Prabhav Thapa**, and I am originally from Nepal. I completed my undergraduate degree in **Chemical Engineering** at *Kathmandu University* in 2020, and I am currently pursuing a **Master’s in Chemical and Petroleum Engineering** at the *University of Calgary*. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in **process modeling, design, and simulation**, which continues to be one of my primary areas of focus.

I have gained practical experience with several industry-standard tools, including **Aspen Plus, Aspen HYSYS, and Aspen Adsorption**, which I have applied in both academic and research settings. These tools have helped me explore a wide range of chemical engineering applications such as **process optimization, energy efficiency, and CO₂ capture technologies**. I am especially motivated by the role of simulation in driving sustainable and innovative solutions for the energy sector.

This repository is primarily created as a **knowledge-sharing platform** for students, researchers, and professionals who are interested in **process modeling and simulation**. My goal is to update it regularly with new projects, focusing mainly on Aspen Plus, and covering topics from **basic process design** to **advanced modeling and analysis**. Each project will be structured to provide both practical insights and useful learning material.

In addition to Aspen projects, I plan to incorporate **numerical modeling with Python**, which I see as a highly versatile tool for chemical engineers. Python can be applied to **data analysis, mathematical modeling, and process optimization**, making it an excellent complement to commercial simulation software. By combining Aspen simulations with Python-based modeling, this repository aims to demonstrate practical workflows that can enhance both learning and professional practice.

I strongly believe **knowledge grows best when shared**. By keeping this repository open-source, I hope to foster collaboration and create a community where ideas can be exchanged freely. My vision is to build a space where we can **learn, share, and grow together** as we explore the exciting possibilities of process modeling and design.
